This tool doesn't work with truecrypt, because the breakpoints never get hit.
This is probably because either

    (1) TrueCrypt is forking, or
    (2) TrueCrypt is IPCing to the "core" process that's running

...and I'm not going to spend time fixing it because I have to keep TrueCrypt
volumes mounted on my system, and don't want to attach GDB to my actual
TrueCrypt.
